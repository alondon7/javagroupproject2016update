This java project was developed in CIS 3260 - Java Programming at Georgia State University

Within this repository there are three files (excluding the readme):

1. "Professor's Instructions..." Word Document - This is a documentation of the expectations of the project as well as design requirements

2. "testCases" Word Document - This reflects a particular part of code being executed from the .java file and its associated output on console from the IDE (eclipse). Images are present in the file

3. December12th.java - This is the original source code file that was developed in the Java Development Kit IDE - Eclipse
